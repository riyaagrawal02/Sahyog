# SkillSwap – Peer-to-Peer Skill Exchange Platform

SkillSwap is a MERN-based platform where users can exchange skills directly with each other. Instead of paying money, users trade their abilities — teaching one skill in return for learning another. The platform focuses on community learning, connections, and shared growth.
